The `mvClaim` package provides a flexible modelling framework of mixture of experts (MoE) using bivariate gamma distributions and a range of parsimonious parameterizations via the EM algorithm, as introduced in Hu et al. (2019).
It utilizes the bivariate gamma distribution proposed by Cheriyan (1941) and Ramabhadran (1951), which has not received much attention in the past.
